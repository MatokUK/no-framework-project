# Welcome

This is my simple **Symphony Ad-Hoc Framework** inspired by Symfony
 - Controller
 - HTTP Request
 - Templating
 
**Used 3rd libraries:**
 - bootstrap
 
# How to install
create file name setting.php in project root with this content:

```php
<?php
define('WS_USERNAME', 'your username');
define('WS_PASSWORD', 'your password');
define('WS_DOMAIN', 'your domain');
```

# Unit Test
There are some unit tests... usually I go for 100% coverage but now I have limited resources (xdebug), so I cannot generate coverage report.
